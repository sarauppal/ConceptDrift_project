# Abstract

In the dynamic world, nothing is constant. This is especially true when it comes to data. 
Thus, itâ€™s inevitable that the performance of many machine learning models will decline over time. This is particularly relevant for models related to human behavior that are built on old data which, over time, becomes inconsistent with the new data. This problem, known as data drift, complicates the task of learning a model from data and demands model retraining to maintain adequate performance. This paper considers different types of data drift, peculiarities of the problem, and different methods to detect and address data drift.  We also discuss various approaches to model retraining to combat data drift and give a critical review of existing approaches to the problem.
